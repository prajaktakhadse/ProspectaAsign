Suppose you have a CSV file with the data below.

A1: 5, A2: 7, A3: 9, B1: 3, B2: 8, B3: =4+5, C1: =5+A1, C2: =A2+B2, C3: =C2+B3

This can be represented in an excel sheet below:

A B C

1 5 3 =5+A1

2 7 8 =A2+B2

3 9 =4+5 =C2+B3

I want a program that will take the CSV input above and produce CSV output with the results. If it is a value, then return a value. If it is a formula then calculate the formula and return the value of that formula.

1. How will you tackle the challenge above?
=> As per the given csv file , i can calculate the values as per rows given and formulas mentioned.
As in the first row C = 5 +A1 ,here firstly i will go to  the A1 cell and get the value and calculate it. 
c2 = A2+B2 , here first of all i will get the A2 value and then B2 value and  then finally i will add both 
of them  hence i will get the calculated value of c2. here b3 = 4+5  i will calculate this first and
 then jump to c3 which c2+b3 hence both the values are  present i will calculate the c3.



2. What type of errors you would you check for?
circular dependency may occur due to as formula is given  for ex : in c2 cell a2+b2 is given 
here c2 is calling to a2 and b2 .
And also We can get error like null pointer Exception because as formula is given 
and if the address is not found then we will get the null pointer exception and it can be handled by
 giving default value as 0 or 1.
Format exception cann occur if  some one enter the wrong format so need to handle that error too.

3. How might a user break your code?
